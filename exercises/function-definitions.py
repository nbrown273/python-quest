# Can you make this into a decorator?

# What is your favorite color? Ready a single line function (lambda) to return your response when asked. 
# You never know when you may need it.

# * Is it possible to write a function that specifies all four types of parameters: 
#   positional, keyword, and an arbitrary number of arguments (both positional and keywords)

# Write a function that returns the unique elements of a list as a new list. 

# Can a function possess dynamically added attributes? Imagine you are running a test suite and you want to specify which functions
# are high, medium, and low priority in order to run different variations of the suite. Can you add this
# priority directly to the functions?
