# Guido's Python and the Quest for the Holy Code

This repository contains a series of exercises on introductory Python. Through completing the exercises, developers will learn the fundamentals of the language while gaining some insight into the culture common to Python developers. Gems are also scattered throughout the exercises, providing suggestions for helpful utilities or features not necessary to solve the basics.

Before diving into the exercises I encourage any eager adventure to read through this document (or, better yet, discuss the contents with a Pythonist) to gain a high level summary of the language and some of the common themes to watch out for.

## Summary of Python

* Python is a high-level, interpretted language. 
* Primary aims include:
  * Readability, through words over punctuation and whitespace
  * Extensibility, small core with a large set of libraries
  * Fun (know what I mean \*nudge, nudge\*)
* Batteries are included
* Promotes multiple paradigms:
  * procedural
  * structural
  * object-oriented
  * functional
  * aspect-oriented
  * design by contract
  * logic
 * Should be one and only one *obvious* way to do things

## Outline

The exercises can be broadly categorized into three main sections: Structures, Processes, and Utilities. This repository is broken into directories based on this categorization. An individual may jump between files within any directory but it is recommended to complete the directories in the previously specified order.
