# Guido's Python and the Quest for the Holy Code

This repository contains a collection of short questions, divided up by subject. Through completing these questions you will develop a broad understanding of the foundations of python, and some of the tips and tricks I've found useful over the years. The questions are also engineered to generate discussion around options, culture, style, and other less formal aspects of the language.

## Workshop Instructions

For a 2 hour workshop, it is unlikely a new Python developer will complete every question. In order to facilitate everyone's own interests and needs, the following *adventure* structure is recommended:

1) The instructor will present the basics of each section through live coding.
    * It's recommended to use an IDE with the code and REPL open simultaneously.
2) Students should code along using an installed version of Python or browser based REPL, such as https://repl.it/ 
3) Before each section, students should pick out a handful of questions to focus on. 
    * If no questions are of interest, those marked with an asterisk are suggested focus areas due to hidden details or discussion that can be based on them.
    * Once the instructor has covered the basics of the section, all the questions that were not directly answered can be covered individually.

## Summary of Python

I encourage any eager adventurer to discuss this list with a Pythonist to gain a high level summary of the language and some of the common themes to watch out for before diving into the exercises.

* Python is a **high-level, interpreted** language. 
* Primary aims include:
  * **Readability**, through words over punctuation and whitespace
  * **Extensibility**, small core with a large set of libraries
  * **Fun** (know what I mean \*nudge, nudge\*)
* **Batteries are included**
* Promotes **multiple paradigms**:
  * procedural
  * structural
  * object-oriented
  * functional
  * aspect-oriented
  * design by contract
  * logic
* Should be **one and only one *obvious* way** to do things
  * But it **won't stop you** either
* **Dynamically, strongly, duck** typed
