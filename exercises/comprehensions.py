# Generate an identity matrix (list of lists that's one whenever the row = column position, zero otherwise)

# Initialize a cache from a list of keys, where each value starts as an empty list

# Generate a list containing all integer points within a rectangle of a given width and height, starting at the origin

# * What does the underscore symbol often represent in list comprehensions and loops?

# * Functional programming often chains together calls to map and filter. 
# How would you implement the same chain with list comprehensions.

# If you're going to find the maximum of a mapped set of values, would it be better to use a list comprehension or a generator?

# * Write a generator that yields an infinite list of random numbers. Iterate over the list CAUTIOUSLY, printing out each number.
