# Guido's Python and the Quest for the Holy Code

[INSERT DESCRIPTION OF REFINEMENT PROCESS]

## Summary of Python

I encourage any eager adventurer to discuss this list a Pythonist to gain a high level summary of the language and some of the common themes to watch out for before diving into the exercises.

* Python is a high-level, interpretted language. 
* Primary aims include:
  * Readability, through words over punctuation and whitespace
  * Extensibility, small core with a large set of libraries
  * Fun (know what I mean \*nudge, nudge\*)
* Batteries are included
* Promotes multiple paradigms:
  * procedural
  * structural
  * object-oriented
  * functional
  * aspect-oriented
  * design by contract
  * logic
 * Should be one and only one *obvious* way to do things
  * But it won't stop you either

## Outline

The exercises can be broadly categorized into three main sections: Structures, Processes, and Utilities. This repository is broken into directories based on this categorization. An individual may jump between files within any directory but it is recommended to complete the directories in the previously specified order.
